;                            Fast Hex Reading
;
; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; (read-hex stream) reads a hex value (e.g., FF9900) from stream and returns it
; as an integer, or returns NIL to indicate the stream does not start with a
; hex value.  More details:
;
;   - We accept digits in either case, e.g., 37ff or 37FF or 37Ff are all fine.
;
;   - Any leading zeroes are accepted and ignored.
;
;   - No hex prefixes are expected or accepted, e.g., if your stream contains
;     things like #FF9900, 0xFF9900, or #xFF9900, then you will need to do
;     something else to strip these leading #, 0x, or #x prefixes first.
;
;   - No underscores or whitespace within the number are accepted.
;
; Internally we read things using read-char...
;
;   - Although read-sequence is faster, it seems difficult to provide a nice
;     interface if we use it since it may read past the number we're parsing
;
;   - Read-line seems to be using a lot of memory.  CCL's read-line also seems
;     very slow, i.e., ~6x slower than SBCL's.  So it seems better to read the
;     stream directly instead of parse a string.  (Well, we could provide
;     functions for both, of course.)
;
; We also prefer to use unread-char instead of peek-char.  This appears to be
; quite a bit faster on both CCL and SBCL.

; General idea:
;  - Read in up to 60 bits at a time.
;  - Turn that 60 bits into a fixnum.
;  - Merge the 60-bit chunks together.
